- [CppCon 2015: Andrei Alexandrescu ‚Äústd::allocator...‚Äù][1] talks about 
the histroy of allocator and how to build allocators via composition.
- [CppCon 2017: Bob Steagall ‚ÄúHow to Write a Custom Allocator‚Äù][2] covers 
the interface/implementation of allocators in cpp03. Be ready for tons of types
and traits üò±
- [CppCon 2017: Pablo Halpern ‚ÄúAllocators: The Good Parts‚Äù][3] talks about 
the allocator interface and how to write a custom allocator.

Jason Turner has a short video series on allocators:
- [C++ Weekly - Ep 222 - 3.5x Faster Standard Containers With PMR!][4] shows
pmr containers are faster due to fewer memory allocation calls.
- [C++ Weekly - Ep 235 - PMR: Amazing, Fast, But, Not Quite Magic][5] explains
the inner workings of `monotonic_buffer_resource`.
- [C++ Weekly - Ep 236 - Creating Allocator-Aware Types][6] gives an example
of user defined allocator aware type. You want to make sure the allocator 
is "forwarded" for all the subcomponents of the objects.
- [C++ Weekly - Ep 245 - PMR: Mistakes Were Made (By Me)][7] shows that 
initializer list "does not" work with allocator well. Objects using different 
allocators must be copied rather than moved.
